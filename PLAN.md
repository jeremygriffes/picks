# Plan

1. Build out database to support users/players/games
2. Figure out deployment. Firebase hosting?
3. Fix season builder - it builds only the current phase of the season.
4. Improvement: refresh season occasionally. Especially post-season, where TBDs become known after
   competitions complete.
5. Figure out roles: sys_admin, game_admin, player
6. Build admin interfaces
7. Build an integration test to replay a season
