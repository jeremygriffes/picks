# Plan

1. Build out database to support users/players/games
2. Figure out auth and roles: sys_admin, game_admin, player.
3. Figure out deployment. Firebase hosting?
4. Fix season builder - it builds only the current phase of the season.
5. Improvement: refresh season occasionally. Especially post-season, where TBDs become known after
   competitions complete.
6. Build admin interfaces
7. Build an integration test to replay a season
